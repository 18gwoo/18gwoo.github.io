    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Garrett Woo and I am currently a junior at LaQuinta High School. I currently have no idea what I am going to do with my life and have no real major goal at the moment. For fun I usually just go out with friends and family. Another hobby of mine is to play video games. My favorite thing about school is the ability to see freinds every day and play football. After high school i hope to travel a little bit then settle down somewhere nice and with alot of people around.</p>
